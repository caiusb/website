On April 8th this year, I had [a talk](https://events.bizzabo.com/700468/agenda/session/1607892) at the [2025 Iceberg Summit in San Francisco](https://www.icebergsummit2025.com/).
This is a professional talk, where I covered how, at [Etleap](https://etleap.com), we achieved 5 second ingestion using [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) and [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/).
The recording was published today, and I'm including it here if you're interested.

It was an honor to host the talk.
